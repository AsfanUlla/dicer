# Dicer

- Web Scraper to scrape jobs data from www.dice.com
- (Note: Indeed kept blocking(403), didn't have enough time to figure it out so went with dice.com which is similar to indeed)
- Api starts scraping in the background if the data is not available in the local Database this behaviour can also be forced check api docs below

## Prerequisites

- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Python 3.10.x

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## DB Configuration

- Modify DB configuration accordingly, located in `piccolo_conf.py`

```python
DB = PostgresEngine(config={
    'host': <db_host>,
    'database': <db_name>,
    'user': <db_user>,
    'password': <db_passwd>
})
```

## Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## API Features `/jobs?<params>`

- Fast
- Pagination
- Sort
- Query based on technology and location
- Rate Limit 20/min
- Unit tests
- [Piccolo ORM](https://piccolo-orm.com/)

(Note: Api is designed in such a fasion that if the query result is empty it will initiate a background task to scrape 50 jobs based on the query parameters)
